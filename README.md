# 🧠 HR Policy Chatbot | Open-Source LLM + Chroma + Streamlit

A **simple, cost-effective, and practical chatbot tool** designed to help employees navigate company policies with ease! This project combines the power of **open-source LLMs** (via [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/)), **Chroma vector database**, and a user-friendly **Streamlit UI**. Instead of endlessly searching policy documents or bothering HR with repetitive questions, employees can now get instant answers—**with clarity and accuracy**.

If the chatbot can't find an answer, it kindly guides you to contact the **HR team** for clarification. No more confusion, and no more guesswork!

## 🏗️ How It Works (Step-by-Step Breakdown)

### 1. **Document Collection**
- Gather all relevant **HR policies**, **guidelines**, and **company documents**.
  
### 2. **Preprocessing & Chunking**
- Documents are **preprocessed** (cleaning, formatting) and **split into smaller chunks**.
- Chunking ensures better **context handling** and **retrieval accuracy**.

### 3. **Embedding Creation**
- Each chunk is converted into a **dense vector representation (embedding)**.
- We use **Ollama's embedding models** (or any preferred embedding model) to transform text into vectors.

### 4. **Store in Chroma Vector Database**
- These embeddings are stored in the **Chroma** vector database.
- Chroma enables **efficient semantic search** over these embeddings based on user queries.

### 5. **User Interaction via Streamlit Frontend**
- Users interact through a **simple Streamlit web app**.
- Enter your query, and the system works its magic behind the scenes.

### 6. **Semantic Search + Prompt Engineering**
- User queries are **converted into embeddings**.
- Chroma retrieves the most relevant document chunks.
- We use **prompt engineering** to craft a context-aware prompt for the LLM, feeding it both the query and relevant chunks.

### 7. **LLM Response (Ollama)**
- The **open-source LLM** (running locally via Ollama) generates an accurate, helpful answer based on the documents.
- If the system can't find sufficient information, it prompts the user to **contact HR** directly for further clarification.

## 🎯 Why Not Just Use an LLM Without a Vector Database?

### ❌ The Challenge with Plain LLMs:
- LLMs are **general-purpose**. They don't **know your specific company policies**.
- You'd have to **fine-tune** an LLM on your data—expensive, time-consuming, and resource-heavy.
- **Token limits** make it impossible to feed the entire policy document into the LLM with every question.
- **Accuracy suffers** without relevant context.

### ✅ Our Approach Solves This:
- By using **embeddings + vector search**, we **retrieve only the relevant information**.
- **Reduces token usage**—only sending necessary context to the LLM.
- **Speeds up responses** and **improves relevance**.
- **No need for fine-tuning**—prompt engineering plus retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) works great!
- You **cut costs** dramatically by:
  - Using **open-source LLMs** instead of paid APIs.
  - Running everything **locally** (via Ollama), no external data sharing.

## 💡 Use Case & Practical Benefits

### 👩‍💼 For Employees:
- Get **instant answers** to HR policies (leave policy, reimbursement process, etc.).
- Saves time compared to reading through long policy documents.

### 🏢 For Companies:
- **Reduces repetitive HR queries**, freeing HR teams for higher-value tasks.
- **Data privacy**: All sensitive company data stays **on-premises**.
- **Cost-effective solution** with **no per-query fees**.
- Easy to **update and maintain** as policies change.
